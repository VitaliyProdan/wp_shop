== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I show the messages only in the cart page and not in the checkout? =
In Yit Plugins->Cart Messages ->Settings page, you can choose where to show the messages.

= What are the main changes in plugin translation? =
Recently YITH WooCommerce Cart Messages has been selected to be included in the "translate.wordpress.org" translate programme.
In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'yit' to 'yith-woocommerce-cart-messages'.
Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org.
During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in:

* yith-woocommerce-cart-messages-[WORDPRESS LOCALE].po
* yith-woocommerce-cart-messages-[WORDPRESS LOCALE].mo
